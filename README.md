Hi,
This document is a readme where I am going to explain what you can found into this project.

	1- Folder "Ejercicio1"
		This folder contains a python file (.py). This file is the result of the first exercice
		of Devo test.
		
		There is not another .py with unitTest, I have just put some test into this same file.
		That mean that you can launch (into your python cmd) this file and you will see some result.
		Or you can import the file and use the unique function named "kind_of_numbers".
		This function use one argument (array of integer).
		If the input used is not good, there is not a failed exception, otherwise a print that mentioned that
		your input is not good. In a case of a bad input, the function return an empty value.
		
		if your input is ok the function return an array of tupple.
		Tupple first value is input number.
		Tupple second value is a string that defined kind of number ("perfecto", "abundante", "defectivo").
		
		
	2- Folder "Ejercicio 2"
		This folder contains 3 files (index.html, style.css, index.js). These file are the results of the second exercice
		of Devo test.
		
		Launch the file index.html into your web browser and you will see a web page with two highchart, using javascript and 
		online JSON input data.
		
Thank you for your time used to read the readme.

Hoping that these exircices responding to your expectation.

Best regards.
